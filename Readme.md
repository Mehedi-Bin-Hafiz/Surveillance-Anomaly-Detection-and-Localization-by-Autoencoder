# Surveillance Anomaly Detection by Autoencoder

![Surveillance Anomaly Detection](anomany.png "anomaly sample")

## Project Overview

This project leverages a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder** to detect anomalies in surveillance video data. By reconstructing normal sequences, the model flags anomalies based on reconstruction error thresholds. It's ideal for tasks like identifying unusual activities in video footage.

## Features

- **LSTM Autoencoder**: Harnesses temporal patterns for anomaly detection.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Streamlines data normalization and sequence preparation.
- **Visualization**: Includes loss graphs for performance tracking.
- **Customizable Threshold**: Tweak anomaly sensitivity via reconstruction error thresholds.
- **Exportable Model**: Save trained models for future inference.
